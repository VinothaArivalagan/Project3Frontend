        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Here's how it works: When you sign up with Freecycle.org, you join groups. You make posts about things you want to gift or receive.
             Other members reply and then you arrange a pickup time and location. Just like that, you've saved something from going to a landfill
              and given it a new life.

<p>As a nonprofit, The Freecycle Network's server and operating expenses are funded by grants, underwriting/sponsorship, ad royalties and
 individual donations. Our IRS 990s are available for review on Guidestar.org. Town groups are run by volunteer moderators and members
  take part in this worldwide gifting movement that reduces waste, saves precious resources and eases the burden on our landfills.</p>
